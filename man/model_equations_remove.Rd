\title{Endo-Exo switch
Creates a new model base on an existing one with some endos and exos switched}
\usage{
model_equations_remove(
  base_model,
  new_model_name,
  equations_to_remove,
  endos_to_remove,
  algo = TRUE,
  rcpp = FALSE,
  env = globalenv(),
  rcpp_path = getwd(),
  use.superlu = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{base_model}{: the reference model to be used (obviously a thoR.model)}

\item{new_model_name}{: character string, must be different from base model name}

\item{equations_to_remove}{: vector of equations to remove, selected by equation name or id}

\item{endos_to_remove}{: vector of  endogenous variables from base model to remove. There must be as many as distinct equations, correspond to one equation each. If they still appear in the model, they will be considered as exogenous variables.}

\item{algo}{boolean. TRUE if using decomposition of model (recommended for large model). Default : TRUE}

\item{rcpp}{boolean. TRUE if using Rcpp for solver (recommended for large model). Default : FALSE}

\item{env}{Environment where to store the model object. Default : globalenv()}

\item{rcpp_path}{path to directory where to store the rcpp source files for the model. Default : working directory}

\item{use.superlu}{boolean. If SUPERLU library is installed, select TRUE to compile a rcpp model with superlu}
}
\value{
a thor.model in the selected environment
}
